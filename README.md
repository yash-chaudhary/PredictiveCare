## Problem Statement
The dawn of COVID-19 has made people more invested in their personal health. If they display symptoms of COVID-19, they are ordered to quarantine to avoid the risk of infecting others. But what about other diseases? Unless you’re medically inclined, it incredibly hard to have certainty in a diagnosis you find with a web search, given the symptoms you’re experiencing. Therefore, the problem is that the average person knows the symptoms they are feeling but do not have the medical knowledge to determine a possible diagnosis. The pandemic has shown that people need accurate information and data to be assured about the health of themselves and their family and friends. Machine learning is able to automate the diagnosis process by leveraging datasets that state the symptoms and their subsequent diagnosis to predict the disease that a patient may have. Using supervised learning we can predict the diagnosis (label) from a list of symptoms (features) using different classification models. The use of AI will not only educate the public on the diseases they might have but it can also double as a “second opinion” for patients and doctors.
